# Project Objectives
Clean dirty log data and transform it for analytics.

Exploratory data analysis, e.g. find user activity levels for different events, and user interaction with web components.

Find the conversion rate of users, identify key factors that bottleneck the conversion rate.

Propose any hypothesis and set up experiments for testing.

Build machine learning models to predict user behaviors, including but not limited to signup, churn, etc.

Discover interesting insights in the dataset and suggest how to improve the user signup rate.
